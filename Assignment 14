1) Assignment 7 took me the longest to do.  Well to be truthful, I actually didn't get the chance to finish it. 
   For some reason I couldn't get the table-drive selection to work.  
2) Assignment 7 was the most difficult assignement to do.  It took a while for me to understand how it worked conceptually.
   But unfortunately I could not complete it due to compiling errors.  
3) While I am not confused by any of the material conceptually, I still find pushing and popping memory off the stack a bit weird.  It
   seems a bit overwhelming at times to keep track of what was last pushed on the stack and the various locations of memory on the stack.
   But this, I believe, is simply due to the fact that I've gotten too comfortable with higher level languages doing it automatically
   for me.
4) I would've liked to spend more time on using conditional processing, procedures, and loops all together.
5) Assignment 1 was in my opinion the most tedious, as we had to constantly convert numbers.  But I suppose it's good to know how to 
   do it without an online calculator.
6) All of the programming assignments were my favorite.  
7) I learned the most from assignment 6.  My understanding of how memory worked improved vastly from messing around with the debugger.
8) I thought the assignement requirements and due dates were perfectly clear.
9) I would rate this course a difficulty of 2.  The coursework we encountered wasn't too particularly difficult.  I do believe, however,
   that assembly programming is a very powerful, but equally difficult to use program, depending on the level of versatility we
   wish to achieve.
10) I thought the book was fine for the most part, though I wished it explained the examples in more detail.  
11) I would've liked to see practical applications of assembly language.  Stuff people would typically use it for.
12) Same as previous answer.
