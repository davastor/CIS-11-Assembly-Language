1.1.3

1.)An assembler converts source-code programs into machine language.  
   A linker then combines those individual files into a single executable program.
3.)A single statement in a high-level language expands into multiple assembly language or machine instructions.
8.)You cannot assign a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type in C or C++, whereas in assembly, there are no such restrictions.
12.)mov eax, y
    mov ebx, 4
    imul ebx
    add eax, 3
    mov x, eax
    
1.2.1
2.)A computer is made up of levels or layers of instruction sets or processing.  Each level of processing can be represented by
   a "virtual machine" that operates using a particular language that it supports at that layer.  The lowest level of processing may be 
   written in a language that is perhaps too cumbersome for people to manipulate.  Hence, a higher level "virtual machine", 
   with a more accessible language, is used to allow people to input their commands with greater ease.  
   That higher level instruction set is then translated back down to the lower level for the computer to process.  
   Even higher level "virtual machines" may be used for increased accessbility, if need be.
